Bayesian A/B Testing with stopping rule

Simulation if Bayesian A/B test with a stopping rule. Three major steps of Bayes testing: 1) initialize some prior beliefs, 2) performs test, 3) create posterior beliefs. The stopping rule is the following: when the expected loss is below the specified threshold. This certain “threshold” determines which option (A or B) is better. The code is in "Bayes AB test" file.
